):
    """Utility function which compares a tensor against a reference based on tolanceres
    on desired quantiles. Comparing different algorithms in FP32, and especially FP16
    and BF16, is often hard through e.g. ``torch.allclose`` as absolute differences
    in a element-to-element comparison fail when some outliers are present. It sometimes
    is better to compare quantiles with different tolerances allowing some outliers while
    enforcing stricter absolute tolerances for most of the elements.

        tensor to be compared against reference
    ref : torch.Tensor

        indicates a comparison of the 25%, the 50%, and the 75% quantile.
    tolerances : List[float]
        list of floats indicating the absolute corresponding tolerances for
        all individual quantiles passed into this function
