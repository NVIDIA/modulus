Simple Logging and Checkpointing recipe
========================================

Logging and checkpointing are important comonents of model training workflow. It allows
users to keep a record of the model hyper-parameters and its performance on training.

In this tutorial we will look at some of the utilities from Modulus to simplify this
important aspect of model training. 

Logging in Modulus
-------------------

Modulus provides utilities to standardize the logs of different training runs. Using the
logging utilites from Modulus, you would have the flexibility of choosing between the
good-old console logging to more advanced ML experiments trackers like MLFlow and 
Weights & Biases. You can always implement these loggers yourself, but in this example,
we will use the utilites from Modulus that will not only simplify this process but also
provide a standardized output format. Let's get started.

Console logging
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The below example shows a simple setup using the console logging.

.. literalinclude:: ../test_scripts/test_console_logger.py
   :language: python
   :start-after: [imports] 
   :end-before: [imports]

.. literalinclude:: ../test_scripts/test_console_logger.py
   :language: python
   :start-after: [code] 
   :end-before: [code]

The logger output can be seen below.

.. code-block:: bash

MLFlow logging
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The below example shows a simple setup using the MLFlow logging. The only difference from
the previous example is that, we will use ``initialize_mlflow`` function to initialize
the MLFlow client and also set ``use_mlflow=True`` when initializing the ``LaunchLogger``.

.. literalinclude:: ../test_scripts/test_mlflow_logger.py
   :language: python
   :start-after: [imports] 
   :end-before: [imports]

.. literalinclude:: ../test_scripts/test_mlflow_logger.py
   :language: python
   :start-after: [code] 
   :end-before: [code]

During the run, you will notice a directory named as ``mlruns_0`` created which stores
the mlflow logs. To visulaize the logs interactively, you can run the following:

.. code-block:: bash

    mlflow ui --backend-store-uri mlruns_0/

And then navigate to localhost:5000 in your favorite browser.

.. warning::

    Currently the MLFlow logger will log the output of each processor separately. So in
    multi-processor runs, you will see multiple directories being created. This is a known
    issue and will be fixed in the future releases.


Weight and Biases logging
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The below example shows a simple setup using the Weights and Biases logging. The only
difference from the previous example is that, we will use ``initialize_wandb`` function
to initialize the Weights and Biases logger and also set ``use_wandb=True`` when 
initializing the ``LaunchLogger``.

.. literalinclude:: ../test_scripts/test_wandb_logger.py
   :language: python
   :start-after: [imports] 
   :end-before: [imports]

.. literalinclude:: ../test_scripts/test_wandb_logger.py
   :language: python
   :start-after: [code] 
   :end-before: [code]

During the run, you will notice a directory named as ``wandb`` created which stores
the wandb logs. 

The logger output can also be seen below.

.. code-block:: bash

   Warp 0.10.1 initialized:
      CUDA Toolkit: 11.5, Driver: 12.2
      Devices:
        "cpu"    | x86_64
        "cuda:0" | Tesla V100-SXM2-16GB-N (sm_70)
        "cuda:1" | Tesla V100-SXM2-16GB-N (sm_70)
        "cuda:2" | Tesla V100-SXM2-16GB-N (sm_70)

Checkpointing in Modulus
--------------------------

Modulus provides easy utilities to save and load the checkpoints of the model, optimizer,
scheduler, and scaler during training and inference. Similar to logging, custom
implementation can be used, but in this example we will see the utilites from Modulus and
some of its benefits.

Loading and saving checkpoints during training
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The example below shows how you can save and load a checkpoint during training. The implementation
allows the model training to be resumed from the last saved checkpoint. Here, we will
demonstrate the use of ``load_checkpoint`` and the ``save_checkpoint`` functions. 

.. literalinclude:: ../test_scripts/test_basic_checkpointing.py
   :language: python
   :start-after: [imports] 
   :end-before: [imports]

.. literalinclude:: ../test_scripts/test_basic_checkpointing.py
   :language: python
   :start-after: [code] 
   :end-before: [code]

The output of the above script when loaded from a partially trained model will be
something like below. 

.. code-block:: bash

    >>> python test_scripts/test_basic_checkpointing.py
    ...
    [23:11:09 - checkpoint - INFO] Loaded model state dictionary /workspace/release_23.11/docs_upgrade/modulus/docs/checkpoints/FourierNeuralOperator.0.10.mdlus to device cuda

    [23:11:16 - checkpoint - INFO] Saved training checkpoint: /workspace/release_23.11/docs_upgrade/modulus/docs/checkpoints/checkpoint.0.15.pt
    [23:11:21 - checkpoint - INFO] Saved model state dictionary: /workspace/release_23.11/docs_upgrade/modulus/docs/checkpoints/FourierNeuralOperator.0.20.mdlus
    [23:11:21 - checkpoint - INFO] Saved training checkpoint: /workspace/release_23.11/docs_upgrade/modulus/docs/checkpoints/checkpoint.0.20.pt


Loading checkpoints during inference
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For loading the checkpoint in inference, the process is simple and you can refer the samples
provided in :ref:`running-inference-on-trained-models` and :ref:`saving-and-loading-modulus-models` .
