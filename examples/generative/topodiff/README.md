# TopoDiff
We propose Topodiff, a conditional diffusion-model-based architecture to perform performance-aware and manufacturability-aware topology optimization that overcomes the issues of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) such as difficult to train, limited generalizability and neglecting manufacturability. Topodiff introduces a surrogate model-based guidance strategy that actively favors structures with low compliance and good manufacturability.

## Dataset
Link to the dataset: [here](https://www.dropbox.com/home/decode_lab/Datasets/Public%20Documents/Topodiff_dataset)

Download the dataset and set the **path_data** in [the config yaml file](conf/config.yaml)

## Instructions 
2D topology structures could be generated by Topodiff conditioned on the boundary and loading conditions. A few examples are shown below:

### Model training 
Before training the model, config.yaml should be: 
```
hydra:
  job:
    chdir: True
  run:
    dir: ./outputs/


path_data: path to the Topodiff dataset downloaded 

epochs: 200000
batch_size: 128
lr: 1e-4 

classifier_iterations: 30000
regressor_iterations: 30000
diffusion_steps: 1000

generation_path: ./
model_path_diffusion: /home/turbo/Qian/modulus/modulus/outputs/model_300000.pt
model_path_classifier: /home/turbo/Qian/modulus/modulus/outputs/classifier.pt
```

Run the following command to train the diffusion model, classifier for floating material and regressor for compliance:
```Bash
python examples/generative/topodiff/train.py
python examples/generative/topodiff/train_classifier.py
python examples/generative/topodiff/train_regressor.py
```
### Generation
By default, the generated topologies are conditioned on the boundary and loading conditions that have not been seen in the training process.
Run the following command to generate topologies: 
```Bash
python examples/generative/topodiff/inference.py
```
