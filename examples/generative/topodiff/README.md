# TopoDiff
We propose Topodiff, a conditional diffusion-model-based architecture to perform performance-aware and manufacturability-aware topology optimization that overcomes the issues of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) such as difficult to train, limited generalizability and neglecting manufacturability. Topodiff introduces a surrogate model-based guidance strategy that actively favors structures with low compliance and good manufacturability.
