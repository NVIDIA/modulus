## Overview
Denoising Diffusion Probablistic Models (DDPM) are a strong tool for data super-resolution and reconstruction. Unlike many other deep learning models which require a pair of low-res and high-res data for model training, DDPM is trained only on the high-res data. This feature is especially beneficial to reconstructing high-fidelity CFD data from low-fidelity reference, as it allows the model to be more independent of the low-res data distributions and subsequently more adaptive to various data patterns in different reconstruction tasks.

## Datasets
Datasets used for model training and sampling can be downloaded via the following links.

- High resolution data (ground truth for the super-resolution task) (<a href="https://figshare.com/ndownloader/files/39181919">link</a>)

- Low resolution data measured from random grid locations (input data for the super-resolution task) (<a href="https://figshare.com/ndownloader/files/39214622">link</a>)


## Running the Experiments
Download the high res and low res data and save the data files to the subdirectory ``modulus/examples/generative/diffusion/Kolmogorov_2D_data/``.

- Note: The directory from which the downloaded dataset files are loaded is specified in the configuration yaml files at ``modulus/examples/generative/diffusion/Kolmogorov_2D_data/conf/``. In the case when the default relative file location in a yaml file cannot be correctly recognized, please replace the relative location with the absolute location. For example, in the configuration file "modulus/examples/generative/diffusion/Kolmogorov_2D_data/conf/config_dfsr_train.yaml", Line 24, the value of the key 'data' can be changed to an absolute file directory of the dataset file, e.g., ``/<directory of modulus>/examples/generative/diffusion/Kolmogorov_2D_data/kf_2d_re1000_256_40seed.npy``

<b>Step 1 - Model Training</b>

In directory ``modulus/examples/generative/diffusion/``, run:

(without physics-informed conditioning)

``
python train.py --config-name=config_dfsr_train
``

or 

(with physics-informed conditioning)

``
python train.py --config-name=config_dfsr_cond_train
``

<b>Step 2 - Super-resolution</b>

In directory ``modulus/examples/generative/diffusion/``, run:

(without physics-informed conditioning)

``
python train.py --config-name=config_dfsr_generate
``

or 

(with physics-informed conditioning)

``
python train.py --config-name=config_dfsr_cond_generate
``
