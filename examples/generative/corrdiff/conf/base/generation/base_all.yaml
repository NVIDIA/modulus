defaults:
    - sampler: stochastic
    # Recommended is stochastic sampler. Change to deterministic if needed.

num_ensembles: ???
# Number of ensembles to generate per input. Should be overridden.
seed_batch_size: ???
# Size of the batched inference. Should be overridden.
inference_mode: all
# Choose between "all" (regression + diffusion), "regression" or "diffusion"
hr_mean_conditioning: true
# Whether to use hr_mean_conditioning
times_range: ???
# Time range to generate. Should be overridden.
has_lead_time: False
# Whether the model has lead time.

perf:
  force_fp16: false
    # Whether to force fp16 precision for the model. If false, it'll use the precision
    # specified upon training.
  use_torch_compile: false
    # whether to use torch.compile on the diffusion model
    # this will make the first time stamp generation very slow due to compilation overheads
    # but will significantly speed up subsequent inference runs
  num_writer_workers: 1
    # number of workers to use for writing file
    # To support multiple workers a threadsafe version of the netCDF library must be used
