## Main options
res_ckpt_filename: "./checkpoints/diffusion.mdlus"   
  # Checkpoint filename for the generative model  
reg_ckpt_filename: "./checkpoints/regression.mdlus"
  # Checkpoint filename for the mean predictor model
image_outdir: "image_outdir"
  # Where to save the output images
seeds: "0-63"
  # Random seeds used for generation
class_idx: null  
  # Class label. Null is random
num_steps: 8
  # Number of sampling steps
sample_res: "full"
  # Sampling resolution
regression_only: false
  # regression only inference
diffusion_only: false
  # diffusion only inference
sampling_method: deterministic
  # Sampling method ["stochastic", "deterministic"]
seed_batch_size: 32
  # batch size across the seed dimension
force_fp16: true
  # Whether to force fp16 precision for the model. If false, it'll use the precision
  # specified upon training.
num_writer_workers: 1
  # number of workers to use for writing file
  # To support multiple workers a threadsafe version of the netCDF library must be used
use_torch_compile: True
  # whether to use torch.compile on the diffusion model
  # this will make the first time stamp generation very slow due to compilation overheads
  # but will significantly speed up subsequent inference runs

## Data options
patch_shape_x: 448
patch_shape_y: 448
  # Patch size. Patch-based sampling will be utilized if these dimensions differ from 
  # img_shape_x and img_shape_y
overlap_pixels: 0 
  # Number of overlapping pixels between adjacent patches
boundary_pixels: 0
  # Number of boundary pixels to be cropped out. 2 is recommanded to address the boundary
  # artifact.
hr_mean_conditioning: false
  # High-res mean (regression's output) as additional condition
gridtype: "sinusoidal"
  # can be either linear, sinusoidal, or learnable
