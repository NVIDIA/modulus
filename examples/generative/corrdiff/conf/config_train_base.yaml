## Hyperparameters
training_duration: 200000
  # Training duration based on the number of processed images, measured in kilo images (thousands of images)
total_batch_size: 256
  # Total batch size
batch_size_per_gpu: 2
  # Batch size per GPU
lr: 0.0002
  # Learning rate
dropout: 0.13
  # Dropout probability
hr_mean_conditioning: False
  # High-res mean (regression's output) as additional condition
gridtype: "sinusoidal"
  # can be either linear, sinusoidal, or learnable
N_grid_channels: 4

## Performance options
fp_optimizations: fp32
  # Floating point mode, one of ["fp32", "fp16", "amp-fp16", "amp-bf16"]
  # "amp-{fp16,bf16}" activates Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP) with {float16,bfloat16}
enable_cudnn_benchmark: false
  # Enable cuDNN benchmarking
dataloader_workers: 4
  # DataLoader worker processes
songunet_checkpoint_level: 0 # 0 means no checkpointing
  # Gradient checkpointing level, value is number of layers to checkpoint


## I/O-related options
