# Base parameters for dataset, model, training, and validation
defaults:

    - dataset: cwb
    # The dataset type for training.
    # Accepted values:
    #   `gefs_hrrr`: full GEFS-HRRR dataset for continental US.
    #   `hrrr_mini`: smaller HRRR dataset (continental US), for fast experiments.
    #   `cwb`: full CWB dataset for Taiwan.
    #   `custom`: user-defined dataset. Parameters need to be specified below.

    - model: regression
    # The model type.
    # Accepted values:
    #     `regression`: a regression UNet for deterministic predictions
    #     `lt_aware_ce_regression`: similar to `regression` but with lead time
    #       conditioning
    #     `diffusion`: a diffusion UNet for residual predictions
    #     `patched_diffusion`: a more memory-efficient diffusion model
    #     `lt_aware_patched_diffusion`: similar to `patched_diffusion` but
    #       with lead time conditioning

    - model_size: normal
    # The model size configuration.
    # Accepted values:
    #     `normal`: normal model size
    #     `mini`: smaller model size for fast experiments

    - training: ${model}
    # The base training parameters. Determined by the model type.


# Dataset parameters. Used for `custom` dataset type.
# Modify or add below parameters that should be passed as argument to the
# user-defined dataset class.
