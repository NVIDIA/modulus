# MeshGraphNet for transient vortex shedding

This example is a re-implementation of the DeepMind's vortex shedding example
<https://github.com/deepmind/deepmind-research/tree/master/meshgraphnets> in PyTorch.
It demonstrates how to train a Graph Neural Network (GNN) for evaluation of the
transient vortex shedding on parameterized geometries.

## Problem overview

Mesh-based simulations play a central role in modeling complex physical systems across
various scientific and engineering disciplines. They offer robust numerical integration
methods and allow for adaptable resolution to strike a balance between accuracy and
efficiency. Machine learning surrogate models have emerged as powerful tools to reduce
the cost of tasks like design optimization, design space exploration, and what-if
analysis, which involve repetitive high-dimensional scientific simulations.

However, some existing machine learning surrogate models, such as CNN-type models,
are constrained by structured grids,
making them less suitable for complex geometries or shells. The homogeneous fidelity of
CNNs is a significant limitation for many complex physical systems that require an
adaptive mesh representation to resolve multi-scale physics.

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) present a viable approach for surrogate modeling in science
and engineering. They are data-driven and capable of handling complex physics. Being
mesh-based, GNNs can handle geometry irregularities and multi-scale physics,
making them well-suited for a wide range of applications.

## Dataset

We rely on DeepMind's vortex shedding dataset for this example. The dataset includes
1000 training, 100 validation, and 100 test samples that are simulated using COMSOL
with irregular triangle 2D meshes, each for 600 time steps with a time step size of
0.01s. These samples vary in the size and the position of the cylinder. Each sample
has a unique mesh due to geometry variations across samples, and the meshes have 1885
nodes on average. Note that the model can handle different meshes with different number
of nodes and edges as the input.

## Model overview and architecture

The model is free-running and auto-regressive. It takes the initial condition as the
input and predicts the solution at the first time step. It then takes the prediction at
the first time step to predict the solution at the next time step. The model continues
to use the prediction at time step $t$ to predict the solution at time step $t+1$, until
the rollout is complete. Note that the model is also able to predict beyond the
simulation time span and extrapolate in time. However, the accuracy of the prediction
might degrade over time and if possible, extrapolation should be avoided unless
the underlying data patterns remain stationary and consistent.

The model uses the input mesh to construct a bi-directional DGL graph for each sample.
The node features include (6 in total):

- Velocity components at time step $t$, i.e., $u_t$, $v_t$
- One-hot encoded node type (interior node, no-slip node, inlet node, outlet node)

The edge features for each sample are time-independent and include (3 in total):

- Relative $x$ and $y$ distance between the two end nodes of an edge
- L2 norm of the relative distance vector

The output of the model is the velocity components at time step t+1, i.e.,
$u_{t+1}$, $v_{t+1}$, as well as the pressure $p_{t+1}$.

A hidden dimensionality of 128 is used in the encoder,
processor, and decoder. The encoder and decoder consist of two hidden layers, and
the processor includes 15 message passing layers. Batch size per GPU is set to 1.
Summation aggregation is used in the
processor for message aggregation. A learning rate of 0.0001 is used, decaying
exponentially with a rate of 0.9999991. Training is performed on 8 NVIDIA A100
GPUs, leveraging data parallelism for 25 epochs.

## Getting Started

This example requires the `tensorflow` library to load the data in the `.tfrecord`
format. Install with

```bash
pip install tensorflow
```

To download the data from DeepMind's repo, run

```bash
cd raw_dataset
sh download_dataset.sh cylinder_flow
```

To train the model, run

```bash
python train.py
```

Data parallelism is also supported with multi-GPU runs. To launch a multi-GPU training,
run

```bash
mpirun -np <num_GPUs> python train.py
```

If running in a docker container, you may need to include the `--allow-run-as-root` in
the multi-GPU run command.

Progress and loss logs can be monitored using Weights & Biases. To activate that,
set `wandb_mode` to `online` in the `constants.py`. This requires to have an active
Weights & Biases account. You also need to provide your API key. There are multiple ways
for providing the API key but you can simply export it as an environment variable

```bash
export WANDB_API_KEY=<your_api_key>
```

The URL to the dashboard will be displayed in the terminal after the run is launched.
Alternatively, the logging utility in `train.py` can be switched to MLFlow.

Once the model is trained, run

```bash
python inference.py
```

This will save the predictions for the test dataset in `.gif` format in the `animations`
directory.
