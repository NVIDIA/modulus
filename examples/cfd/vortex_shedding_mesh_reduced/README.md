# Temporal attention model in Mesh-Reduced space for transient vortex shedding

This example is an implementation of the paper "Predicting Physics in Mesh-reduced Space
with Temporal Attention" in PyTorch.
It demonstrates how to train a Graph Neural Network (GNN) as encoder to compress the
high-dimensional
physical state into latent space and apply a multi-head attention model for temporal
predictions for
the transient vortex shedding on parameterized geometries.

## Problem overview

## Dataset

We use vortex shedding dataset for this example. The dataset includes
51 training, and 50 test samples that are simulated using OpenFOAM
with irregular triangle 2D meshes, each for 401 time steps with a time step size of
0.5s. These samples vary in the Reynolds number. Each sample share the same mesh with
1699 nodes.

## Model overview and architecture

The model is auto-regressive. It first encodes the graph state into a latent vector
via a Graph
Nueral Network. Then a multi-head temporal model takes the initial condition tokens
and pysical paramerters
as the input and predicts the solution for the following sequence in the latent space
just like a language model.

The model uses the input mesh to construct a bi-directional DGL graph for each sample.
The node features include (3 in total):

- Velocity components at time step $t$, i.e., $u_t$, $v_t$
- Pressure at time step $t$, $p_t$

The edge features for each sample are time-independent and include (3 in total):

- Relative $x$ and $y$ distance between the two end nodes of an edge
- L2 norm of the relative distance vector

The output of the model is the velocity components for the following steps, i.e.,
$[\ldots, (u_{t}$, $v_{t}), (u_{t+1}$, $v_{t+1}), \ldots]$, as well as the
pressure $[\ldots,p_{t},p_{t+1}\,\ldots]$.

For the PbGMR-GMUS, a hidden dimensionality of 128 is used in the encoder, and decoder.
The encoder and decoder consist of two hidden layers. Batch size per GPU is set to 1
for the encoding-decoding process.
Mean aggregation is used in the processor for message aggregation. A learning rate of
0.0001 is used, decaying
exponentially with a rate of 0.9999991. Traing epochs is set as 300.

For the multi-head attention temporal model, the dimension for each token is
$3 \times 256 = 768$. The hidden dimension usded in
the temporal model is $4 \times 768 = 4072$. The number of head is 8. Batch size
per GPU is set to 10 for the sequence model training. Traing epochs is set as 200000.

## Getting Started

To download the data , run

```bash
wget --content-disposition https://api.ngc.nvidia.com/v2/resources/nvidia/physicsnemo/modulus_datasets_cylinder-flow/versions/v1/zip -O physicsnemo_datasets_cylinder-flow_v1.zip
unzip physicsnemo_datasets_cylinder-flow_v1.zip
unzip dataset.zip
```

This example requires the `torch-scatter` and  `torch-clsuster` library for the
graph nodes agrregation. Install with

```bash
conda install pytorch-scatter -c pyg
conda install pytorch-cluster -c pyg
```

To train the encoding-decoding model, run

```bash
python train.py
```

To test the reconstruction error, run

```bash
python test.py
```

To train the sequence model, run

```bash
python train_sequence.py
```

Once the model is trained, run

```bash
python test_sequence.py
```
