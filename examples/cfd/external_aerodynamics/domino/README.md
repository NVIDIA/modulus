# DoMINO: Decomposable Multi-scale Iterative Neural Operator for External Aerodynamics

DoMINO is a local, multi-scale, point-cloud based model architecture to model large-scale 
physics provlems such as external aerodynamics. The DoMINO model architecture is designed 
to evaluate flow field quantities on both the surface of the car as well as in the volume 
around it.

The DoMINO model architecture is used to support the Real Time Wind Tunnel OV Blueprint 
demo presented at Supercomputing' 24.

More details on the model architecture and reference pipeline will be released soon.
