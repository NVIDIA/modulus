# DoMINO: Decomposable Multi-scale Iterative Neural Operator for External Aerodynamics

DoMINO is a local, multi-scale, point-cloud based model architecture to model large-scale 
physics problems such as external aerodynamics. The DoMINO model architecture takes STL 
geometries as input and evaluates flow quantities such as pressure and 
wall shear stress on the surface of the car as well as velocity fields and pressure 
in the volume around it. The DoMINO architecture is designed to be a fast, accurate 
and scalable surrogate model for large-scale simulations.

The DoMINO model architecture is used to support the Real Time Wind Tunnel OV Blueprint 
demo presented at Supercomputing' 24.

More details on the model architecture and reference pipeline will be released soon.
