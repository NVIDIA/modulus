# Nested Fourier Neural Operater for Darcy Flow

This example demonstrates how to set up a data-driven model for a
2D Darcy flow using
the Nested Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) architecture inside of Modulus.
Training progress can be tracked through
[MLFlow](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/index.html).
This case is parallelised to run in multi-GPU settings.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Install the required dependencies by running below:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Start with generating the dataset for training:

```bash
python generate_nested_darcy.py
```

which will create the folder `./data` with `out_of_sample.npy`,
`training_data.npy`, `validation_data.npy`.

To train the model on a single GPU, run

```bash
python train_nested_darcy.py +model=ref0
python train_nested_darcy.py +model=ref1
```

For training a model on two GPUs, run

```bash
mpirun -n 2 python train_nested_darcy.py +model=ref0
mpirun -n 2 python train_nested_darcy.py +model=ref1
```

To evaluate the model use:

```bash
python evaluate_nested_darcy.py
```

Progress can be monitored using MLFlow. Open a new terminal and
navigate to the training directory, then run:

```bash
mlflow ui -p 2458
```

View progress in a browser at <http://127.0.0.1:2458>

If training on a remote machine, set up a ssh tunnel to the server with
`LocalForward 8080 your_remote_machine_addr:8080`.
ssh to the server via the specified port, in this case `8080`,
navigate to the training directory and launch mlflow server

```bash
mlflow server --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
```

On your local machine, open a browser and connect to `localhost:8080`.
