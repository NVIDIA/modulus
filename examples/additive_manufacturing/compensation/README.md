# PyTorch version of deformation predictor & compensation

## Introduction 

This work addresses shape deviation modeling and compensation in additive manufacturing (AM) to improve geometric accuracy for industrial-scale production. While traditional methods laid the groundwork, recent machine learning (ML) advancements offer better precision. However, challenges remain in generalizing across complex geometries and adapting to position-dependent variations in batch production. We introduce GraphCompNet, a novel framework combining graph-based neural networks with GAN-inspired training to model geometries and incorporate position-specific thermal and mechanical variations. Through a two-stage adversarial process, the framework refines compensated designs, improving accuracy by 35-65% across the print space. This approach enhances AM's real-time, scalable compensation capabilities, paving the way for high-precision, automated manufacturing systems.

## Training

- To test running with cpu ``Connfig.yaml`` setting (not recommended): 
  
    - `` cuda: False ``
    - ``use_distributed: False``
    - ``use_multigpu: False``
- Gpu training: set params listed above to True

- There are two training codes that need to run in sequential manner.
1. ``train_dis.py``: This code trains the discriminator (predict part deformations with its position and geometry) 
2. ``train_gen.py``: This code trains the generator (compensate part geometry)
