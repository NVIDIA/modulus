## Contributing examples to Modulus Repo

### Pre-requisites:
1. Read the [code contribution guidelines](https://github.com/NVIDIA/modulus/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
2. What needs to be part of the submission
    1. Training scripts and corresponding datasets for other community members to replicate
    2. Inference scripts and checkpoints for other community members to replicate
3. Please make sure the code and dataset are cleared to be open-sourced under Apache 2.0
4. Make yourself familiar with Modulus-Core, Modulus-Launch or Modulus-Sym as appropriate:
    1. [Modulus-Core](https://github.com/NVIDIA/modulus) includes a collection of models, utilities, and dataloaders
    2. [Modulus-Launch](https://github.com/NVIDIA/modulus-launch) contains a collection of training recipes and examples. Modulus is a dependency of Modulus-Launch but not vice versa 
    3. [Modulus-Sym](https://github.com/NVIDIA/modulus-sym) provides an abstraction layer for using PDE-based symbolic loss functions.

### Recommended Best practices 
1. Wherever possible, avoid  duplicate code. Example: 
    1. Use the network implementations already in Modulus.
    2. Try using the dataloaders and utilities that already exists in Modulus.
    3. Trying using the existing logging utilities [example](https://github.com/NVIDIA/modulus-launch/blob/04f598c4556eb598630946816f01dd97467621de/examples/cfd/vortex_shedding_mgn/train.py#L188).
2. Please follow the checkpointing convention/utility in Modulus for saving and loading your checkpoints [example](https://github.com/NVIDIA/modulus-launch/blob/04f598c4556eb598630946816f01dd97467621de/examples/cfd/vortex_shedding_mgn/train.py#L180).

### General Instructions for adding examples
1. Organizing your code and artifacts as follows:
    1. Create a new folder with the same name in the appropriate folders
    2. Architecture/dataloaders/utilities go to Modulus-Core:
        - Network architectures: [under models](https://github.com/NVIDIA/modulus/tree/main/modulus/models)
        - Utilities: [under utils](https://github.com/NVIDIA/modulus/tree/main/modulus/utils)
        - Dataloader: [under datapipes](https://github.com/NVIDIA/modulus/tree/main/modulus/datapipes)
    3. Training/validation/inference scripts and the relevant utilities go to Modulus-Launch. Place these scripts in a folder under [examples in Modulus-Launch](https://github.com/NVIDIA/modulus-launch/tree/main/examples).

2. Per the contributing document: 
    1. Make forks of Modulus-Core and Modulus-Launch
    2. Push your code to your forks
    3. Once ready, open a PR to the upstream branches
    4. Make sure you prepare your code according to the CI requirements. That includes unit tests and code coverage, docstrings, black formatting, and doctests.

3. Please move all of your dependencies to Modulusâ€™s pyproject.toml.

4. Please make sure your dependencies and any of the sub-dependencies are not touching GPL or L-GPL code. In rare cases, we might be able to clear a code that touches L-GPL code but there are hard restrictions on GPL code.

5. Please add documentation with all your results and plots as a README.md file in Modulus_launch. Modulus documentation is being refactored and we will migrate your documentation to Modulus documentation once ready.

### Signing Your Work

* We require that all contributors "sign-off" on their commits. This certifies that the contribution is your original work, or you have rights to submit it under the same license, or a compatible license.

  * Any contribution which contains commits that are not Signed-Off will not be accepted.

* To sign off on a commit you simply use the `--signoff` (or `-s`) option when committing your changes:
  ```bash
  $ git commit -s -m "Add cool feature."
  ```
  This will append the following to your commit message:
  ```
  Signed-off-by: Your Name <your@email.com>
  ```
