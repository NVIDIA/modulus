## Problem overview

FourCastNet, short for Fourier Forecasting Neural Network, is a global data-driven
weather forecasting model that provides accurate short to medium-range global
predictions at 0.25∘ resolution. FourCastNet accurately forecasts high-resolution,
fast-timescale variables such as the surface wind speed, precipitation, and atmospheric
water vapor. It has important implications for planning wind energy resources,
predicting extreme weather events such as tropical cyclones, extra-tropical cyclones,
and atmospheric rivers. FourCastNet matches the forecasting accuracy of the ECMWF
Integrated Forecasting System (IFS), a state-of-the-art Numerical Weather Prediction
(NWP) model, at short lead times for large-scale variables, while outperforming IFS
for variables with complex fine-scale structure, including precipitation. FourCastNet
generates a week-long forecast in less than 2 seconds, orders of magnitude faster than
IFS. The speed of FourCastNet enables the creation of rapid and inexpensive
large-ensemble forecasts with thousands of ensemble-members for improving probabilistic
forecasting. We discuss how data-driven deep learning models such as FourCastNet are a
valuable addition to the meteorology toolkit to aid and augment NWP models.

FourCastNet is based on the [vision transformer architecture with Adaptive Fourier
Neural Operator (AFNO) attention](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=EXHG-A3jlM)

## Dataset

The model is trained on a 20-channel subset of the ERA5 reanalysis data on single levels
and pressure levels that is pre-processed and stored into HDF5 files.
The subset of the ERA5 training data that FCN was trained on is hosted at the
National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC). For convenience
[it is available to all via Globus](https://app.globus.org/file-manager?origin_id=945b3c9e-0f8c-11ed-8daf-9f359c660fbd&origin_path=%2F~%2Fdata%2F).
You will need a Globus account and will need to be logged in to your account in order
to access the data. You may also need the [Globus Connect](https://www.globus.org/globus-connect)
to transfer data. The full dataset that this version of FourCastNet was trained on is
approximately 5TB in size.

## Model overview and architecture

Please refer to the [reference paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.11214) to learn about
the model architecture.

## Getting Started

To train the model, run

```bash
python train_era5.py
```

Progress can be monitored using MLFlow. Open a new terminal and navigate to the training
directory, then run:

```bash
mlflow ui -p 2458
```

View progress in a browser at <http://127.0.0.1:2458>

Data parallelism is also supported with multi-GPU runs. To launch a multi-GPU training,
run

```bash
mpirun -np <num_GPUs> python train_era5.py
```

If running inside a docker container, you may need to include the `--allow-run-as-root`
in the multi-GPU run command.
