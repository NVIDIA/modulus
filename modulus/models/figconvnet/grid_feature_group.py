    The set of grid features inside a GridFeatureGroup are distinct and do not

    element-wise multiplication.

    Mathematically, for a set of grid features $\mathcal{G} = {G_1, G_2, ...,

    For each $G_i \in \mathcal{G}$, we compute the communication with all other
    grid features $G_j \in \mathcal{G}$, $j \neq i$. This is done by sampling
    the features of $G_j$ at the vertices of $G_i$ and adding or multiplying the
    sampled features to the features of $G_i$: $G_i(v) = G_i(v) + \sum_{j \neq
    i} G_j(v)$ where $v$ are the vertices of $G_i$.
