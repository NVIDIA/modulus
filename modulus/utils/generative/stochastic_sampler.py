    Proposed EDM sampler (Algorithm 2) with minor changes to enable

    Parameters
    ----------
    net : Any
        The neural network model that generates denoised images from noisy
        inputs.
    latents : Tensor
        The latent variables (e.g., noise) used as the initial input for the
        sampler. Has shape (batch_size, C_out, img_shape_y, img_shape_x).
    img_lr : Tensor
        Low-resolution input image for conditioning the super-resolution
        process. Must have shape (batch_size, C_lr, img_lr_ shape_y,
        img_lr_shape_x).
    class_labels : Optional[Tensor], optional
        Class labels for conditional generation, if required by the model. By
        default None.
    randn_like : Callable[[Tensor], Tensor]
        Function to generate random noise with the same shape as the input
        tensor.
        By default torch.randn_like.
    patching : Optional[DeterministicPatching], optional
        A patching utility for patch-based diffusion. Implements methods to
        extract patches from an image and batch the patches along `dim=0`.
        Should also implement a `fuse` method to reconstruct the original image
       from a batch of patches. See
       :class:`modulus.utils.patching.DeterministicPatching` for details. By
       default None, in which case non-patched diffusion is used.
    mean_hr : Optional[Tensor], optional
        Optional tensor containing mean high-resolution images for
        conditioning. Must have same height and width as `img_lr`, with shape
        (B_hr, C_hr, img_lr_shape_y, img_lr_shape_x)  where the batch dimension
        B_hr can be either 1, either equal to batch_size, or can be omitted. If
        B_hr = 1 or is omitted, `mean_hr` will be expanded to match the shape
        of `img_lr`. By default None.
    num_steps : int
        Number of time steps for the sampler. By default 18.
    sigma_min : float
        Minimum noise level. By default 0.002.
    sigma_max : float
        Maximum noise level. By default 800.
    rho : float
        Exponent used in the time step discretization. By default 7.
    S_churn : float
        Churn parameter controlling the level of noise added in each step. By
        default 0.
    S_min : float
        Minimum time step for applying churn. By default 0.
    S_max : float
        Maximum time step for applying churn. By default float("inf").
    S_noise : float
        Noise scaling factor applied during the churn step. By default 1.

    Returns
    -------
    Tensor
        The final denoised image produced by the sampler. Same shape as
        `latents`: (batch_size, C_out, img_shape_y, img_shape_x).
