    """
    Reconstructs a full image from a batch of patched images.

    This function takes a batch of image patches and reconstructs the full
    image by stitching the patches together. The function accounts for
    overlapping and boundary pixels, ensuring that overlapping areas are
    averaged.

    Parameters
    ----------
    input : Tensor
        The input tensor containing the image patches with shape (patch_num
        * batch_size, channels, patch_shape_y, patch_shape_x).
    img_shape_y : int
        The height (y-dimension) of the original full image.
    img_shape_x : int
        The width (x-dimension) of the original full image.
    batch_size : int
        The original batch size before patching.
    overlap_pix : int
        The number of overlapping pixels between adjacent patches.
    boundary_pix : int
        The number of pixels to crop as a boundary from each patch.

    Returns
    -------
    Tensor
        The reconstructed full image tensor with shape (batch_size, channels,
        img_shape_y, img_shape_x).
