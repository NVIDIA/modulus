    Profiler Class to enable easy, simple to configure profiling tools in modulus.
    
    This is meant to be used as a reusable context manager for profile capturing.
    Integrate it into StreamCapture for simplest use, after configuration.  But, you
    don't have to integrate it: This profiler tool could be used to capture profiles from code or
    functions in other contexts.
    
    It is not a singleton class, so you could make more than one, but it IS meant to be
    reused in a StreamCapture - one per capture.  When used this way, it will track entrances/exits
    from the profiling context and decorate output traces accordingly.
    
    In other words, you could capture the training and validation loops separately, but the training loop
    will use the same profiler each iteration.
    
    It's suggested that you do not profile every time, since that adds some overhead.  Instead, use a shorter
    run for profiling and then disable the profiler entirely. (pass `enabled=False` in the constructor, which is default.)
