    Abstract class to wrap a profiler interface.

    Modulus provides some useful profiling tools and configurations
    out of the box, but also is designed to enable other tools to plug

    can attach a new profiler to your runs and activate it as well.

    You can also quickly and efficiently swap profiling tools without
    modifying model code: deactivate one profiler, reactivate another,
    and modulus will automatically handle the details.

    are implemented as class-based singletons.  That means when you create a pytorch
    profiler, it is created one time and reused at every file that also creates one.

    method is explicitly called.
