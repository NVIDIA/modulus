#### What is the recommended hardware for training using Modulus framework?
Please refer to the recommended hardware section: System Requirments [https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/modulus/getting-started/index.html#system-requirements]

#### What model architectures are in Modulus?
Nvidia Modulus is built on top of PyTorch and you can build and train any model architecture you want in Modulus. Modulus however has a catalog of models that have been packaged in a configurable form to make it easy to retrain with new data or certain config parameters. Examples include xxx
Modulus samples have more models that illustrate how a specific approach with a specifc model architecture can be applied to a specific problem. These are reference starting points for users to get started.
You can find the list of built in model architectures here:  


#### What is the difference between Modulus Core and Symbolic?
Modulus core is the foundational modulus that provides the core algorithms, network architectures and utilities that cover a broad spectrum of Physics-ML approaches. Modulus Symbolic
