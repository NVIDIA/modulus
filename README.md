[tailor made datapipes](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/modulus/modulus-core/api/modulus.datapipes.html),
[validation utilities](https://github.com/NVIDIA/modulus-sym/tree/main/modulus/sym/eq)
to enhance the end to end training speed.

### A suite of Physics Informed ML Models

Modulus offers a comprehensive library of state-of-the-art models specifically designed
for physics-ML applications.
The [Model Zoo](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/modulus/modulus-core/api/modulus.models.html#model-zoo)
includes generalizable model architectures such as
[Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs)](modulus/models/fno),
[DeepONet](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/modulus/modulus-sym/user_guide/neural_operators/deeponet.html),
[Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/modulus/modulus-sym/user_guide/foundational/1d_wave_equation.html),
[Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)](modulus/models/gnn_layers),

### Easy Customization and Extension

Modulus is designed to be highly extensible, allowing users to add new functionality
with minimal effort. The framework provides Pythonic APIs for
defining new physics models, geometries, and constraints, making it easy to extend its
capabilities to new use cases.
The adaptability of Modulus is further enhanced by key features such as
