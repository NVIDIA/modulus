Modulus is an open source deep-learning framework for building, training, and fine-tuning
deep learning models using state-of-the-art Physics-ML methods.

Whether you are exploring the use of Neural operators like Fourier Neural Operators or
interested in Physics informed Neural Networks or a hybrid approach in between, Modulus
provides you with the optimized stack that will enable you to train your models at real
world scale.

This package is the core module that provides the core algorithms, network architectures
and utilities that cover a broad spectrum of physics-constrained and data-driven
workflows to suit the diversity of use cases in the science and engineering disciplines.

Detailed information on features and capabilities can be found in the [Modulus documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/modulus/index.html#core).

## Modulus Packages

- [Modulus (Beta)](https://github.com/NVIDIA/modulus): Open-source deep-learning
  framework for building, training, and fine-tuning deep learning models using
  state-of-the-art Physics-ML methods.
- [Modulus Symbolic (Beta)](https://github.com/NVIDIA/modulus-sym): Framework
  providing pythonic APIs, algorithms and utilities to be used with Modulus
  core to physics inform model training as well as higher level abstraction
  for domain experts.

### Domain Specific Packages

- [Earth-2 MIP (Beta)](https://github.com/NVIDIA/earth2mip): Python framework
  to enable climate researchers and scientists to explore and experiment with
  AI models for weather and climate.
  
## Installation

### PyPi

The recommended method for installing the latest version of Modulus is using PyPi:

```Bash
pip install nvidia-modulus
```

The installation can be verified by running a simple python code snippet as shown below:

```python
python
>>> import torch
>>> from modulus.models.mlp.fully_connected import FullyConnected
>>> model = FullyConnected(in_features=32, out_features=64)
>>> input = torch.randn(128, 32)
>>> output = model(input)
>>> output.shape
torch.Size([128, 64])
```

#### Optional dependencies

Modulus has many optional dependencies that are used in specific components.
When using pip, all dependencies used in Modulus can be installed with
`pip install nvidia-modulus[all]`. If you are developing Modulus, developer dependencies
can be installed using `pip install nvidia-modulus[dev]`. Otherwise, additional dependencies
can be installed on a case by case basis. A detailed information on installing the
optional dependencies can be found in the
[Getting Started Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/modulus/getting-started/index.html).

### NVCR Container

The recommended Modulus docker image can be pulled from the
[NVIDIA Container Registry](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/teams/modulus/containers/modulus):

```Bash
docker pull nvcr.io/nvidia/modulus/modulus:24.04
```

Inside the container you can clone the Modulus git repositories and get started with the
examples. Below command show the instructions to launch the modulus container and run an
examples from this repo.

```bash
docker run --shm-size=1g --ulimit memlock=-1 --ulimit stack=67108864 --runtime nvidia \
--rm -it nvcr.io/nvidia/modulus/modulus:24.04 bash
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/modulus.git
cd modulus/examples/cfd/darcy_fno/
pip install warp-lang # install NVIDIA Warp to run the darcy example
python train_fno_darcy.py
```

## From Source

### Package

For a local build of the Modulus Python package from source use:

```Bash
git clone git@github.com:NVIDIA/modulus.git && cd modulus

pip install --upgrade pip
pip install .
```

### Source Container

To build Modulus docker image:

```bash
docker build -t modulus:deploy \
    --build-arg TARGETPLATFORM=linux/amd64 --target deploy -f Dockerfile .
```

Alternatively, you can run `make container-deploy`

To build CI image:

```bash
docker build -t modulus:ci \
    --build-arg TARGETPLATFORM=linux/amd64 --target ci -f Dockerfile .
```

Alternatively, you can run `make container-ci`.

Currently only `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` platforms are supported. If using
`linux/arm64`, some dependencies like `warp-lang` might not install correctly.
